This can happen due to a number of reasons, including bed shortage. The SERVICES table should be used if interested in identifying the type of service a patient is receiving in the hospital. For example, if interested in identifying surgical patients, the recommended method is searching for patients admitted under a surgical service.\n\nEach service is listed in the table as an abbreviation - this is exactly how the data is stored in the hospital database. For user convenience, we have provided a description of each service type.\n\nService | Description\n--- | ---\nCMED | Cardiac Medical - for non-surgical cardiac related admissions\nCSURG | Cardiac Surgery - for surgical cardiac admissions\nDENT | Dental - for dental/jaw related admissions\nENT | Ear, nose, and throat - conditions primarily affecting these areas\nGU | Genitourinary - reproductive organs/urinary system\nGYN | Gynecological - female reproductive systems and breasts\nMED | Medical - general service for internal medicine\nNB | Newborn - infants born at the hospital\nNBB | Newborn baby - infants born at the hospital\nNMED | Neurologic Medical - non-surgical, relating to the brain\nNSURG | Neurologic Surgical - surgical, relating to the brain\nOBS | Observation - not ill enough for a service but kept in hospital for observation\nORTHO | Orthopaedic - surgical, relating to the musculoskeletal system\nOMED | Orthopaedic medicine - non-surgical, relating to musculoskeletal system\nPSURG | Plastic - restortation/reconstruction of the human body (including cosmetic or aesthetic)\nPSYCH | Psychiatric - mental disorders relating to mood, behaviour, cognition, or perceptions\nSURG | Surgical - general surgical service not classified elsewhere\nTRAUM | Trauma - injury or damage caused by physical harm from an external source\nTSURG | Thoracic Surgical - surgery on the thorax, located between the neck and the abdomen\nVSURG | Vascular Surgical - surgery relating to the circulatory system", "important_considerations": [], "detailed_description": {"summary": "", "entries": [[["SUBJECT_ID", "HADM_ID"], "Identifiers which specify the patient: `SUBJECT_ID` is unique to a patient and `HADM_ID` is unique to a patient hospital stay."], [["TRANSFERTIME"], "`TRANSFERTIME` is the time at which the patient moved from the `PREV_SERVICE` (if present) to the `CURR_SERVICE`."], [["PREV_SERVICE", "CURR_SERVICE"], "`PREV_SERVICE` and `CURR_SERVICE` are the previous and current service that the patient resides under."]]}}, "TRANSFERS": {"remarks": "Location of patients during their hospital stay.", "columns": {"ROW_ID": {"remarks": "Unique row identifier.", "type": "INT", "constraints": {"nullable": false}}, "SUBJECT_ID": {"remarks": "Foreign key.

The care unit is defined based upon the ward: if the ward is an ICU cost center, then the care unit defines the type of ICU. If the ward is *not* an ICU then in most cases the care unit is null. There are one or two exceptions to this rule. For example, ```NWARD``` is a ward for newborns.\n\nThe `INTIME` and `OUTTIME` of the transfer event correspond to the `CURR_CAREUNIT`. The `PREV_CAREUNIT` for each row is provided for convenience, and is identical to the `CURR_CAREUNIT` of the previous row (assuming the event is not an admission).\n\nCare units include the following:Care unit | Description\n--- | ---\nCCU | Coronary care unit\nCSRU | Cardiac surgery recovery unit\nMICU | Medical intensive care unit\nNICU | Neonatal intensive care unit\nNWARD | Neonatal ward\nSICU | Surgical intensive care unit\nTSICU | Trauma/surgical intensive care unit"], [["PREV_WARDID", "CURR_WARDID"], "`PREV_WARDID` and `CURR_WARDID` contain the previous and current ward in which the patient stayed.
